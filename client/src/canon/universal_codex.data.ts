  2. Navigate to the **Rongorongo Script** and activate its 'rhythm' sonic signature.
  3. Ask the Oracle: "What is the inevitable conclusion of the path from [Concept A] to [Concept B]?"
- **Outcome (Superpower):** The Oracle provides a direct, logical analysis of the most probable outcome of the chosen path, stripping away emotional bias and focusing purely on the chain of cause and effect.

---

### Key of Naphtali (The Tărtăria Tablets)

#### **The Dream Scribe**
- **Resonance with:** The Liber Primus (Joseph)
- **Description:** Use the pure expression of Naphtali to give form to the complex interpretations of Joseph, allowing you to articulate and understand profound insights from the dreamscape.
- **Ritual:**
  1. Navigate to the **Liber Primus** and meditate on a recent dream or a complex, intuitive feeling.
  2. Activate its 'crystal' sonic signature.
  3. Navigate to the **Tărtăria Tablets**.
