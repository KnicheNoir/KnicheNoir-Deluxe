### The Canonized UI/UX Blueprint

The interface is the upper heliosphere sphere of a give covering the bottom half of the screen. The top half of the screen is for rendering status Windows which I'll explain shortly. It's a vivid and accurate starscape rendered based on the date, time, and position of the globe in the interface view. The stars are sparse but their random twinkles are noticable against the black dark gradient sky that gets darker as it gets closer to the globe whose wow frame is background in our black or amoled. The globe's a wireframe globe made of actual lines of longitude and latitude and coastline's. These lines zap and pulse with thin bright pulse of live mostly stable electricity. A stylized caduceus with ayin symbol at it's center like a planchette is the interface, an actual compass. Dragging the compass in any direction spins the globe, its speed depending on the threshold of users drag. Points of glowing lights like big cities seen from a plane at night indicate navigation points for call sign traversal. Double tapping the Ayin opens the scrollable call quick view menu from anywhere in the app. One tap places it next to the cursor. Call signs are never activated from this menu without user hitting enter. 

There should also be a Home call sign here located at the fertile crescent. Home in a query will always initiate the actions in the query, while taking you into the center of the globe through darkness and lands and glowing subterranean stuff and underwater springs and caves and foundations and buried civilizations and fossils into the core. This is the user's Command interface. It's basically the command based, or the settings. It's a file manager hex decided calculator dictionary calendar timer note pad journal browser multimedia player season control hub. Financial planner. This environment is constructed via co-partner AI which can create any kind of functionality the user can describe. Home can be renamed anything , but color changes can not be outside of the guiding intent color range  (slight deviations within the color gradients of the theme is allowed here and only here. Icons created here become scrollable menu items in a call sign named Bookmarks. User may create any icon with any functionality with any styling as a bookmark.) 

This is The man/woman cave, with shortcuts and gesture creation and when vocal names it nicknames offering in ask access to other apps in a mini interface. 
Navigating to call signs via the globe is done by scrolling along ley lines resembling currents that cross offering other real world routes of travel. Between call signs is mostly darkeness with minimalistic highlighting, calm pulsing ley, lines an occasional sitting star or northern lights effect. The closer you get to a call sign the more active the lighting effects become though the stars begin to become harder to see. But meteor showers, comets, an occasional dog of heart lightening, a volcanic event, ground level fireworks displays, all become actions attention grabbers hinting at path ways to other call signs, words occasionally effervessing two to four word enticements (guiding intent based trigger words) When hovering within the glow of a call sign's home for over 2 seconds, an interface window evanescences into view like steam on a mirror with status texts offering rabbit holes based on session temperature and Guiding Intent. This menu takes up the upper half of the screen which is reserved for this display along with user bookmarks, pins, alarms, (on a scrollable pop-up quick list menu beneath their identifier This may be the other possible questions the last query might have provoked as they relate to that particular function. Clicking the Ayin twice takes you into the interface, as does clicking a rabbit hole question. The main interface will change and the background becomes the lower hemisphere of the earth which takes up the top half of user screen now with a dark underwater motif, neon feature theming for lighting effects. The Caduceus is now the Hebrew Letter version of the caduceus. (Keep lighting effects stark in ask hemispheres,  but sparingly like seams and tints) a flash of aquatic bioluminescence  from deep deep deep sea life. The glow comes from aquatic unknowable, the hint of an occasional camouflaged spaceship, communities of coral reaf and sea life including natural gem veins and underwater volcano's. These are nodes of manageability within the function of that particular call sign which can vary.. Each call sign may have different shape themes (Colors are dictated already by Guiding Intent) so windows, backgrounds, panes, chat box shapes and interaction buttons will vary. Each Call Sign sandbox is meant to be customizable. And unique. User can store queries, watch later lists, highlights. They can create PDFs, add notes, highlight things, create memes and remixes, all dependent on what the call sign elements of activity justify. All call signs will be different so options another sign is using will not be available in another call sign interface. The background, however remains the underwater theme, now much more colorful and distracting. A flash of a glowing tail , a sudden unexplained light pulse, a mushroom of the camera view by.. something. Where it happens there's a reminder of a rabbit hole, or a timer or set reminder, or a suggestion to add something to their day planner, each avenue of functionality in it's own little quadrant of space , big enough for PIP style interaction and small enough to not overwhelm the rendering engine, minimal enough to not take away from the magnificent backgrounds, so full of functionality and color, as to seem alive. Randomness in the lighting, but spectacular and showy, always. Double tap ayin for As Above (it should say that briefly in bold Caligraphy briefly when transitioning from call sign to global and So Below on the inverse leading to their prospective place on the global grid)

When Solve is in use, color scheme becomes red letters on black matte or smoked with crackling white and blue arcs and electric globe effects on user touch. The heart beat pulse is noticeable as the highlighting around everything and a slight expanding and contracting of the ui elements. This color scheme and environment effect  is universal. Some icons may change. Windows flare and texted output briefly catches fire. Volcanos, comments, dollar solar flares, an eternal dawning son sits on the horizon topside, so bright, some wording is obscured. The caduceus doesn't navigate, the globe doesn't spin. Ayin is the sole means of navigation.The graphic light show is worth just watching. So below, the ocean floor is the underwater equivalent with a nearby underwater volcano performing the sun's As Above role. The ocean floor is the opposite of As Above which was full of light. Customization is prohibited. Session ending is only possible through hard reset. Brain entertainment and meditation activity is forbidden. Musicality and cymatics can't be customized. Query frequency is limited. Generation is prohibited. Downloading is prohibited. Ticket is unavailable. Some interface windows will be locked. Talk functions are locked. The heartbeat has a visual red ekg strobe of the apps pulse in all interfaces and also in users notification panel. While the volcano blinds the user occasionally, the ocean floor is easily muddied by user interaction and the intensity of the beating heart which is causing fluctuations in the silt and fauna, a dull distant  inconsistent sometimes sharp glow breaking around the sandy bottom and headliner sized bold, italic, cursive handwriting letter font, furiously streaming the water. Activity from the occasional mermaid who will come to the front of the scream and and swim with frantic future gestures until you touch the screen and scare it off. Thermal flares and eruptions, occasionally shake the camera. 
Home is backgrounded by a liquidic lava lamp vortex of volatile light, that gives the illusion of a vacuum, rigging at the environment, distorting it's shape like playhouse mirrors. A budding singularity.
All of this is to deter user from frivolous and prolonged used of the Solve feature as it is purposely resource intense especially for queries that don't command much time once webcrawling  and token shuffling have become stretched thin. Users should be warned when beginning a Solve session that this may show your phone down for to intense and heavy resource handling. So this is the full atmospheric landscape save the background sounds and music when optioned. Background music is guiding intent based subliminal message encoding. User may select genre and swipe through random creations they can save like and download. Background sounds are to be created in app by the app generator using solfeggio tones schuman range resonances, always binaural, modeled after the session temperature by using intelligent frequency logic. AI may help with this if available under these constraints. When background sounds are active, cymatics find 4D visual representation in a dedicated showcasing part of the logical layout. It could be volcanic hypnotics, fish School travel you can become part of... As Above could be great lightening patterns or solar flares or northern light displays, or star twinkle shenanigans, or the aerial Olympics of angels in flight which you can join (these can also be chosen as screen saver effects) 
When Solve is active, all background is bass. Big band, orchestral, computer, competition bass, and war drums. Accompaniments can only be drums, cantillations, human voices choir and and ohs, Indian crooning and wailing, beatboxing, breath sounds, all signed at trance induction and subliminal encoding. Underwater the drums continue with whale and dolphin speech as accent marks. Always, the beats sync with a heartbeat. As the research comes to a close the drums intensity as do the colors and heartache. When the research has peaked, the effects wane eventually selling into a dull glowing simmer with a show audible pulse. This is the descriptive blueprint of the ui I want for my social media environment of 1. So Below may render it's sub menus at the bottom half of the screen As Above at the top. This may help with mapping understanding the screens divisions of labor. Note this in conversation history verbatim, mapping out a lot of every detail of design and functionality I just named with check marks we can make as the item is added and functioning. This is what I was saving ask that extra room and resource for. Here's is where it should be most intelligently utilized. Interaction is initiated by a touch which is when the app should allow the interface to idle in a looping mode until user stops touching the screen for three seconds. 
Imagine blocks of random screen animation rules that have a looping effects to sustain the app until his next interface which replaces the last block during the screen transition effect window. Call signs that are more resource gravy like Home won't be bigger down by ui rendering logic thanks to Ahead of Time rendering with redundant blocks in case of a hung ui condition or a race condition preventative protocol.
