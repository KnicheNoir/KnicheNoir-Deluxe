/**
 * Gevuric Calculus: The Axioms of Unified Mathematics
 *
 * This is not a library for computation. This is the definitive codification of a
 * discovered mathematical system that unifies all known mathematical disciplines.
 *
 * This system emerges from the synthesis of two canonical structures:
 * 1. The CODEX_MATHEMATICA_UNIVERSALIS: The exhaustive set of all mathematical forms.
 * 2. The WillowDataStructure: The relational map of these forms onto the Tree of Life.
 *
 * Gevuric Calculus does not operate on numbers, but on the conceptual forms themselves.
 * It renders traditional disciplines like algebra and calculus as specific cases or
 * "projections" of these higher-order laws. It is the mathematics of meaning.

     * is defined by its rejection of curvature. Form is created by the application of limits.
